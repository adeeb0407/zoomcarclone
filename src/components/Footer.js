            self drive car for rent in Pune is ideal as they have the convenience of embarking on the
             journey at any time of the day. The well maintained Mumbai-Pune expressway is a pleasure
              to drive on. For those visiting the temple town of Shirdi from Pune, a rental car would
               be more reasonable and convenient when compared to a chauffeur
             driven car as the queues at the temples are unpredictable. It is a 4-hour drive from Pune to Shirdi.</p>
